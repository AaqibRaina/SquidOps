This module deploys a production-ready Subsquid indexer infrastructure on AWS with comprehensive cost optimization features.

## Usage

```hcl
module "subsquid" {
  source = "./modules/subsquid"

  region      = "us-west-2"
  environment = "prod"
  vpc_id      = "vpc-12345678"

  max_capacity = 4
}
```

## Subsquid Self-Hosting Compliance

This module implements the official Subsquid self-hosting architecture as described in the [Subsquid documentation](https://docs.sqd.ai/sdk/resources/self-hosting/):

1. **Separate Services**: Deploys both `api` and `processor` services as separate ECS tasks
2. **Correct Commands**: Uses `sqd serve:prod` and `sqd process:prod` commands
3. **Proper Port Configuration**: 
   - GraphQL API on port 4350
   - Prometheus metrics on port 3000
4. **Shared Database**: PostgreSQL database shared between services
5. **Persistent Storage**: EFS for shared storage between services

## Architecture

The module deploys:

1. **API Service**: Serves the GraphQL API on port 4350
2. **Processor Service**: Handles blockchain data indexing
3. **PostgreSQL Database**: Stores indexed data
4. **EFS Storage**: Provides persistent storage for both services
5. **Load Balancer**: Routes traffic to the API service
6. **Auto-scaling**: Scales services based on load

## Cost Optimization Levels

The module provides three simple optimization levels:

1. **Basic** - Standard deployment with no cost optimizations
   - On-demand Fargate instances
   - Standard RDS PostgreSQL
   - No caching layer

2. **Balanced** (Default) - Recommended for most workloads
   - Fargate Spot instances (up to 70% savings)
   - Aurora Serverless v2 database
   - Redis caching
   - Connection pooling
   - Response compression
   - EFS lifecycle policy (30 days)

3. **Aggressive** - Maximum cost savings
   - All balanced optimizations
   - More aggressive EFS lifecycle policy (7 days)
   - Smaller database instances
   - More aggressive scaling policies

## Cost Comparison

### Standard Traffic (Up to 500K daily queries per squid)

| Configuration | Monthly Cost Estimate (Per Squid) | Monthly Cost for 5 Squids |
|---------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Subsquid Cloud | $2,000+ | $10,000+ |
| Basic | $300 - $350 | $1,500 - $1,750 |
| Balanced | $180 - $220 | $900 - $1,100 |
| Aggressive | $100 - $140 | $500 - $700 |

This represents potential savings of:
- **Basic**: 82-85% savings compared to Subsquid Cloud
- **Balanced**: 89-91% savings compared to Subsquid Cloud
- **Aggressive**: 93-95% savings compared to Subsquid Cloud

### High Traffic (5M+ daily queries per squid)

| Configuration | Monthly Cost Estimate (Per Squid) | Monthly Cost for 5 Squids |
|---------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Subsquid Cloud | $15,800 - $16,000 | $79,000 - $80,000 |
| Basic | $500 - $600 | $2,500 - $3,000 |
| Balanced | $350 - $450 | $1,750 - $2,250 |
| Aggressive | $250 - $350 | $1,250 - $1,750 |

For high-traffic scenarios, the savings are even more dramatic:
- **Basic**: 96-97% savings compared to Subsquid Cloud
- **Balanced**: 97-98% savings compared to Subsquid Cloud
- **Aggressive**: 98% savings compared to Subsquid Cloud

*Note: Subsquid Cloud pricing is based on their published rates for query volume, archive access, and base subscription costs. Self-hosted costs include all AWS infrastructure components.*

## Cost Optimization

This module includes several features to optimize costs while maintaining performance:

### 1. Fargate Spot Instances

By default, the module uses Fargate Spot instances which can provide up to 70% cost savings compared to On-Demand instances. This is ideal for Subsquid workloads that can tolerate occasional interruptions.

### 2. Graviton Processors

The module can use ARM-based Graviton processors which offer up to 40% better price/performance ratio compared to x86-based instances.

### 3. Aurora Serverless v2

Instead of provisioned RDS instances, the module can use Aurora Serverless v2 which automatically scales based on workload and charges only for the resources you use.

### 4. Redis Caching

The module includes an optional Redis caching layer to reduce database load and improve performance, which can lead to lower database costs.

### 5. Storage Optimizations

- EFS Lifecycle policies to move infrequently accessed data to lower-cost storage tiers
- GP3 storage for better performance at lower cost when using provisioned RDS
